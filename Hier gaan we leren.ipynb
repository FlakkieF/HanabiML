For the Iris classification problem, the model defines the relationship between the sepal and petal measurements and the predicted Iris species. Some simple models can be described with a few lines of algebra, but complex machine learning models have a large number of parameters that are difficult to summarize.\n","\n","Could you determine the relationship between the four features and the Iris species *without* using machine learning?  That is, could you use traditional programming techniques (for example, a lot of conditional statements) to create a model?  Perhapsâ€”if you analyzed the dataset long enough to determine the relationships between petal and sepal measurements to a particular species. And this becomes difficultâ€”maybe impossibleâ€”on more complicated datasets. A good machine learning approach *determines the model for you*. If you feed enough representative examples into the right machine learning model type, the program will figure out the relationships for you.\n","\n","### Select the model\n","\n","We need to select the kind of model to train.
